# CC-15-Badges
CarolinaCon 15 Badge Information

This repo contains the build instructions and the code needed to run on the badge.

To burn new code onto the ATTINY84 you will need a few things.

* [The Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* The [LedControl](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl) library which can be installed [like this.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
* The LedControl library can be used using this [documentation](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LedControl/)
* Finally you will need to setup an Arduino to act as a programmer for the ATTINY84.  Here is a good [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Uno-to-Program-ATTINY84-Arduino-V-185/) for that.
